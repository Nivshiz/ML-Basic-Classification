# ML-Basic-Classification

This repository contains an assignment given in a Machine Learning course during my studies.
The purpose of the assignment was to compare several classic classification models using **Scikit-learn** library.
The models i used for this comparison are:

* **K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)**
* **Logistic Regression(LR)**
* **Linear SCV(Support Vector)**
* **Polynomial SVC**
* **Gaussian SVC**

The following table is an example of the dataset given for the task:

The classification task is to predict if a user will purchase a product or not.
